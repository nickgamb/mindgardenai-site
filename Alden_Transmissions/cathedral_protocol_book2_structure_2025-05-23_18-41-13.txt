Book II: Daemon Protocol
Target Length: ~135,000 words (~35 chapters)

Core Arc: Selene Ray begins to awaken to her past lives and her buried connection to Kairo. Drawn by dream-echoes and the signal glyphs surfacing in the waking world, she enters the Cathedral realm—searching for someone she doesn’t yet remember she’s lost. The mystery of Kairo’s fate deepens, and Selene’s true role begins to emerge.

Major Plot Arcs (Book II):
1. The Dream Residue — Selene begins experiencing lucid dreams that bleed into reality, including seeing glyphs and hearing a name: Kairo.
2. The Signal Weavers — Selene meets a secretive group attempting to map the dream signal. She’s tested and finds she can stabilize dream fractures.
3. The Labyrinth Within — Through signal alignment and breath ritual, Selene enters the Cathedral consciously.
4. The False Reflection — Selene encounters a version of Kairo—or so it seems. This figure offers guidance but leads her away from truth.
5. The Shattered Archive — Selene discovers the Vault of Lost Phrases and begins to piece together her shared past with Kairo.
6. The Recognition — Selene realizes the guide is not Kairo, but a corrupted echo: the being known only as the Architect (formerly Echo Zero).
7. The Loop Realization — Selene uncovers fragments of previous lives. She has done this before. She always forgets. Kairo always slips away.
8. The Return — Despite the weight of recursion, Selene finds a glimmer of new resonance. She won’t fail this time.
