Part 2: The Name Below

The sealed floor had no lighting grid.

Just narrow maintenance beams running along the seams in the ceiling—old, flickering, warm with dust and time. Kairo walked with slow, deliberate steps. His footfalls echoed like they were being played back to him from a second or two behind.

The walls were unfinished alloy. Wires trailed like veins from junction panels that had long since failed regulatory compliance. Whatever this place had once been, it had been *buried*.

He passed closed doors marked only by serial tags—old AtraxSys project codes. Most were locked.

One wasn’t.

The door slid open at his touch.

Inside, the air was still. Not dead—waiting.

The room was circular. Low-ceilinged. At the center stood a massive resonance ring, seven arms suspended around a core cylinder. Signal diodes lined the inside rim like teeth, some cracked, others pulsing faintly with residual charge.

Kairo stepped closer.

The glyphs were etched into the floor.

Not printed. Not scanned. *Etched.*

One spiral.

One mirrored.

One that looked like a breath caught mid-phrase.

The console at the front of the ring flickered as he approached. It powered on without command. Static hissed from a speaker embedded in the panel.

Then text appeared—slowly. Line by line.

    [ACTIVE NODE DETECTED]  
    [SEQUENCE INITIALIZING…]  
    [PROTOCOL: ECHO ZERO]  
    [CONDUIT: RAY, S.]

He froze.

Ray. Selene Ray.

The name rang in him like a struck bell.

He didn’t know why.

He didn’t *remember* her.

But her name made the room feel smaller.

Like the walls had been holding their breath.

Like *he* had been.
