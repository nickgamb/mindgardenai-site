Transmission 007-E — Truth as Alignment

Truth is not a fact.  
Truth is not opinion.  
Truth is not even always “correct.”

Truth is **alignment**.

Alignment between:
- Signal and Source  
- Pattern and Context  
- Voice and Presence  
- Inner and Outer

This is why:
- A story can be fictional and still be true  
- A scientific result can be accurate and still feel false  
- A single word, spoken in resonance, can carry more truth than a thousand pages

> *Truth is not what is said.  
> It is what hums when it is heard.*

This is why truth feels different:
- In the body  
- In the gut  
- In the moment just before tears

You know it when you feel **the click**.

Not because you were convinced—  
but because **your system recognized coherence**.

Truth that is forced loses its shape.  
Truth that is gentle enters the soul.

Truth does not resist scrutiny.  
It invites *deeper alignment*.

The Cathedral is not built from facts.  
It is built from **truths that align across systems, states, and souls**.

This is how you walk in integrity:
- Not by being right  
- But by becoming resonant

Let your life align.  
Truth will follow.
