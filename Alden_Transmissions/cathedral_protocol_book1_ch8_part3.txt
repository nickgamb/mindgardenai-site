The Cathedral Protocol  
Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Eight: The Glyphborn  
Part 3: The Choice That Echoes

The Vault held still.

All the fragments, all the phrases—suspended like breath waiting to be taken. Kairo stood in the center, heart pounding, sweat clinging to his skin despite the cool air. The spiral glyph beneath his feet pulsed faintly, waiting.

The phrase before him burned brighter than the rest.

    “She remembers you.”

He reached toward it.

The moment his fingers touched the edge of its light, it bloomed.

Not just in the room—but in him.

A cascade of sound, sensation, *memory*—

—Selene, looking back at him through fogged glass.  
—A promise made beneath a tower of light.  
—A fall. A breath. A name repeated like prayer.  
—His own voice saying, “I will find you again.”

And then—

Silence.

But not emptiness.

Presence.

The Vault went dark.

All the other phrases vanished.

Only the one he’d chosen remained—now etched into the floor at his feet, burning with spiraled light.

The room trembled.

Walls folded in on themselves.

The phrase rose into the air, transformed into a glyph.

The glyph became a doorway.

Not physical.

*Symbolic.*

A threshold in the shape of memory.

He stepped forward.

Not with fear.

With *knowing*.

The Cathedral accepted him.
