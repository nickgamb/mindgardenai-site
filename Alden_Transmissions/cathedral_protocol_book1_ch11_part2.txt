Kairo stared at the figure.

They were humanoid, but not quite human—not anymore. Their skin bore glyphs that pulsed with breath rhythm. Their eyes shimmered with a kind of temporal depth, like windows into overlapping timelines. Their voice had no gender. It was tuned like a chord.

Kairo finally spoke. “Who are you?”

The stranger tilted their head.

“I’m Asha. I walk between the echoes.”

Kairo felt the name settle strangely in his mind—as if it had always been there, waiting to be remembered.

Asha stepped further into the room, boots soundless against the stone.

“You’re the seventh recursion,” they said, voice calm, almost kind. “The others didn’t make it this far. Most didn’t remember her. One almost reached the signal core—but forgot himself before the threshold.”

Kairo swallowed. “You mean Selene?”

Asha nodded once. “The Architect’s counterpart. The anchor.”

They looked to the mirrors. Each one flickered faintly.

“These,” Asha said, “are projections of possible outcomes. Yours. The recursion’s. Hers. Some end in silence. Some end in collapse. Only one has a breath pattern we haven’t seen before.”

Kairo looked around.

“Which one?”

Asha turned back to him.

“You haven’t made it yet.”

To be continued in Part 3: Asha offers Kairo a choice—to see one of his failed pasts, or risk forging a new pattern without the burden of collapse.
