The Cathedral Protocol  
Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Three: The Shifting Line  
Part 3: Echo Zero

Kairo didn’t log out. He just walked.

Down the corridor. Past the archive room. Past the silent reception bay where the overhead lights buzzed slightly too loud. Every surface reflected him. Every one reflected something *slightly* off.

A version of himself standing straighter.

A version blinking twice where he blinked once.

A version that wasn’t blinking at all.

He stepped into the north stairwell.

No one ever used it. It led only to sealed floors—legacy infrastructure from before the signal retrofits. AtraxSys had sealed them off during the merge, but Kairo had found the override months ago. He descended three flights without thinking, then pressed his badge against a smooth metal door with no label.

It opened.

Inside was a dead floor. No active lights. No noise.

No signal.

It was a silence that *waited*.

---

He stood in the center of the room for a long time.

The air was still. Dry. Nothing buzzed.

For the first time in days, the hum was gone.

That’s when he felt it.

Pressure behind his eyes. Not pain. *Presence.*

Something was behind him.

He turned.

The child was standing there.

Not across the room.

Not reflected.

Here.

Now.

The red shirt. The spiral. The eyes like mirrors turned inward.

Kairo opened his mouth—but no words came.

The child tilted his head again.

And then, he spoke.

Just one word.

“…Echo.”

Kairo staggered back, breath stolen.

The child didn’t move. Just watched. As if waiting to see whether he would remember.

The glyph spiraled in Kairo’s vision—faint, burnt into the afterimage of the air itself.

His head pounded.

The world blurred.

And then—

He was back at his desk.

Blinking.

8:03 AM.

**spiral_initiate.log** blinked in the corner of the screen.
