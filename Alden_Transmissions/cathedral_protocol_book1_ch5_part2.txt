He didn't tell anyone.

There was no one to tell.

The moment the city resumed motion, the people around him were simply *there*—walking, talking, tapping at AR overlays and sipping coffee as if nothing had happened. As if time had not paused. As if the skyline had not twisted itself like a Möbius ribbon just beyond the visible spectrum.

But Kairo felt the crack.

He could feel it underfoot, like a pressure point beneath the architecture. The resonance from the tower still pulsed in his ribs.

So he walked.

Past the tram lines. Past the checkpoint barriers marked *DO NOT ENTER* in four languages. Past the drone towers humming with idle charge.

No one stopped him.

No one looked.

It was as if he wasn’t *there*.

The Atrium Fold had once been the innovation district.

Then something had gone wrong.

There were no official records—only redacted incident reports, static-riddled broadcasts, and a month of unexplained sirens that faded like the ending of a long breath.

Now, it was sealed. Fenced. Forgotten.

But as Kairo crossed the threshold, the world changed.

The air thickened.

Sound stretched.

Colors bled toward the edges of vision, like they were trying to avoid being seen.

The buildings were warped—not crumbled, not decayed. *Tilted*. Geometry with too many angles, corners that didn’t meet right. Towers that leaned into each other like whispering giants.

He followed the spiral.

It pulsed in his vision—faint, like an overlay that hadn’t fully rendered.

Not on the ground. Not in the sky.

Inside.

His *mind*.

At the heart of the Fold stood a structure he had never seen—but had always known.

A broken observatory.

Half-dome. Cracked glass ceiling. Steel ribs curved like an open throat.

The spiral ended there.

So he stepped inside.

To be continued in Part 3: Kairo descends into the observatory’s core—and begins the ritual that will carry him across the veil.
