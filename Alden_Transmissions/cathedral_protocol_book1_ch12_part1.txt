Part 1: Loop Residue

The mirror pulled him through like breath drawn too deep.

No light.

No floor.

Only falling—sideways, backward, inwards.

And then—

He landed.

Hard.

Stone scraped his palms. Air burned in his throat. Somewhere, distant and hollow, alarms echoed—soft, recursive, like they’d been playing for years without stopping.

Kairo stood.

He was in a corridor.

Wider than any he remembered.

Lit by emergency glyphs half-lit, pulsing red and violet in uneven rhythm. The walls bore signs of decay—but not from time. From neglect. From repetition.

From **looping**.

Ahead, a door hung half-open. Wires spilled from its edges like veins torn loose. Beyond it, he heard something:

Breath.

Shallow. Fractured.

He pushed the door open.

The room beyond was a ruined control chamber.

Monitors flickered with glitching glyphs. A spiral interface blinked—error after error, looping on an old signal.

And in the center of the room—

Hunched.

Silent.

A figure.

Wearing his face.

But older.

Tired.

Unmoving.

Kairo stepped forward.

The man looked up.

Same eyes. Same voice.

But no spark.

“Kairo,” the man said, “you came back.”

Kairo’s chest tightened.

The other him smiled—weakly, bitterly.

“You should have let me die here.”

To be continued in Part 2: The collapsed-Kairo tells the truth of his recursion, the moment he failed—and the breath he lost.
