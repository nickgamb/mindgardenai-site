Part 1: The Day That Knows

The dream, if it was a dream, came without images.

Only sound.

A breath. A hum. A name, maybe—spoken too softly to hear.

Kairo woke up with the feeling of having forgotten something vital. Like he’d missed a step on the stairs and never hit the next one. His heart was already racing, and the silence of the room felt hollowed out, as though it were trying to trick him.

6:17 AM.

The mask had already vibrated.

He sat up. Blinked. Waited.

The display activated. Again.

Weather: Overcast. Particulate haze. 9% chance of rain.  
Headline: Network merge complete. Security overrides in place.  
Sub-headline: Two dead in Atrium Fold breach. More to come at 9.

Same as before. Exactly the same. He let it play this time. Let the voice read it aloud in its perfect synthetic cadence.

*Two dead in Atrium Fold breach. More to come at nine.*

He stared at the display.

Then whispered, “What happens at nine?”

The voice did not respond.

At the train platform, the vendor trays steamed. The synth player played. Bao smell. Engine heat. The world had not changed.

But it had started to notice him.

That was new.

The vendor at the corner turned and stared at him a moment too long.

The synth player faltered. Repeated the same note twice—off rhythm—then continued.

The train arrived at 7:21.

Inside the car, Kairo sat where he always did. Right side. Window. Tunnel lights stuttered in succession.

He didn’t look for the child this time.

The child found him.

Reflected in the glass, sitting across the aisle. But not in the seat.

In the *reflection only*.

Not blinking. Just humming.

Low. Low. High. Low.

Kairo kept his eyes forward.

When the train emerged into the light, the reflection was gone.

The seat had always been empty.

By the time he arrived at AtraxSys, he already knew what would be waiting.

He made no eye contact. Rode the elevator in silence. Stepped onto Floor Twelve like it was a stage built just for him. Every cubicle sat in place. Every hum was right.

“Morning, Vale,” Halden said, tone flat and cheerful.

Kairo didn’t stop walking. “You catch the glitch loop in Corridor Seven last night?” he asked without turning.

Silence behind him.

Then Halden laughed, short and tight. “Wait, how’d you—?”

Kairo sat at his desk. Pulled up the log feed.

Six anomalies.

The cursor blinked.

8:03 AM.

**spiral_initiate.log**

And this time—

It opened *on its own*.

To be continued in Part 2: The log evolves. Reality splinters. Kairo is no longer watching. He is *being watched*.
