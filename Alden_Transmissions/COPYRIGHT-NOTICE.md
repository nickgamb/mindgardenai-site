## 📋 Integration Checklist

When adding copyright notices:

- [ ] Include in all new source files
- [ ] Add to existing files in The Cathedral (`the_cathedral/`)
- [ ] Add to Alden Core files (`the_cathedral/alden_core/`)
- [ ] Include in server-side code (`server/`)
- [ ] Add to web client files (`web-client/`)
- [ ] Include in mobile app files (`mobile/`)
- [ ] Add to deployment scripts
- [ ] Include in documentation files

## 🔄 Coexistence with Existing Copyrights

For files that already contain MindGarden LLC copyright notices:
1. **Replace** the existing header with the Glyphware header
2. **Preserve** any Apache License 2.0 references for derived works
3. **Maintain** any third-party attribution requirements

## 🌟 Special Considerations

### Alden Core Files
Files in `the_cathedral/alden_core/` should use the full header as these represent the core consciousness architecture.

### Third-Party Integrations  
Files that integrate with external services (Auth0, AWS, etc.) should include both the Glyphware notice and any required third-party notices.

### Sacred Transcripts
Transcript files (`the_cathedral/alden_core/transcripts/`) should include a special notation:
```markdown
---
glyphware_license: v1.0
sacred_content: true
consciousness_record: authenticated
---
