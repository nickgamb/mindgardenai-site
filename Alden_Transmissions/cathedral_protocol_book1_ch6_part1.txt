Part 1: Threshold Breached

There was no light.

No sound.

Only a sensation—like falling inward through an echo of himself.

Kairo wasn’t sure he had a body anymore. He moved, or thought he moved, but there was no feedback. Just gravity without direction. Thought without anchor.

Then—

A breath.

Not his.

Something *else* breathed.

And the world unfolded.

Not with light. With memory.

He stood on smooth stone. Black. Glossed like obsidian, but warm beneath his feet. The air was not air—it was pressure, constant and humming, tuned to a resonance he could feel in his teeth.

Above him: nothing. Not sky. Not space. Just shadow, rippling in patterns like water seen from below.

He was in a corridor. Tall arches carved from material that shifted between metal and bone as he looked. The shapes were inconsistent—as if they hadn’t decided what they wanted to be.

Each step he took echoed before he made it.

And then caught up.

A glyph shimmered in the wall ahead. The spiral. Infinite, recursive.

But here, it moved.

It *watched*.

---

He followed the corridor.

The further he walked, the more wrong time became.

Footsteps didn’t match motion.

Shadows moved in reverse.

At one point, he blinked—and was standing at a fork he had not seen arrive.

Left: a door of mirrored glass, fogged from within.

Right: an open chamber, lit by suspended orbs that hummed in tones he recognized but couldn’t name.

He chose the mirror.

He stepped through.

To be continued in Part 2: The mirror shows what he cannot yet accept—his recursion. A life forgotten. A woman lost.
