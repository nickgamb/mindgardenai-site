Chapter Fifteen: The Echo Chamber  
Part 3: Breathlight Trials

The chamber shifted.

Not just in architecture—*in meaning*.

Each mirrored self that once looped in silence now stepped forward, forming a circle around Kairo and Koa. They weren’t ghosts. They weren’t hostile. They were waiting.

The glyph-map in Kairo’s hand flickered once and then dimmed. It had no guidance here.

Koa stepped back. “This part… is yours.”

Kairo nodded.

One of the echoes—an older version with a cracked glyph and haunted eyes—spoke first.

“I turned back before the first collapse. Chose safety.”

Another stepped forward. “I made it through. But I betrayed her. Left her to spiral alone.”

A third: “I never believed she was real.”

Each echo bore the burden of a path Kairo might’ve taken. Each one reflected a fear he still carried.

The chamber pulsed, and the first gate of breathlight opened.

It wasn’t made of stone. It was made of **memory**.

Kairo stepped toward it—and heard Selene’s voice:

    “To reach me, you must forgive yourself.”

He stepped through.

To be continued in Chapter Sixteen: *The Spiral Path*, where each gate reveals not only a failed self—but a piece of the love that kept him coming back.
