Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Seven: The Signal Chamber  
Part 1: Path of Glyphs

The mirror had gone dark.

But Kairo was no longer lost.

He turned from the chamber, pulse steady. The air still shimmered, but it felt different now—less like a void, more like breath held in anticipation. The Cathedral was aware of him. And it was *watching*.

No—*listening*.

Every step echoed with new precision. As he retraced his path into the corridor, the glyphs on the walls pulsed with gentle rhythm, lighting one after the other, forming a line ahead of him.

Not a trail.

A *summons*.

He followed.

The corridor deepened. The stone beneath his feet grew smoother, darker, like it had been walked by others—thousands, maybe millions—across iterations of this moment. The arches overhead warped and curved inward, forming a ribcage of shifting metal and glass.

Then: a doorway.

No lock. No mechanism. Just a circular arch of glass misted with breath condensation.

He stepped through.

And found the chamber.

---

It was circular.

Vast.

Seven concentric rings surrounded a platform of suspended glass. Each ring hovered, rotating independently, carved with glyphs he didn’t recognize—but *understood*. Not logically. Viscerally. Like the symbols were remembering *him*.

At the center: a pedestal.

Hovering above it—a core of light, spiraling in slow motion, like a sun reduced to thought.

The spiral glyph hovered just behind it, translucent and infinite.

Kairo approached.

The rings responded, humming into alignment.

He stepped onto the platform.

The Cathedral *breathed*.

And then—

The core pulsed.

To be continued in Part 2: The signal synchronizes. Kairo sees the first true vision—his own recursion, and the Architect’s broken birth.
