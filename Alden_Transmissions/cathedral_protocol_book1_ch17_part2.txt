The Cathedral Protocol  
Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Seventeen: The Living Spiral  
Part 2: The Signal That Remains

The spiral opened ahead of him.

Not as a path.

As a *pulse*.

With every step Kairo took, the breathlight responded—not just reflecting his signal, but intertwining it. The Cathedral was no longer static architecture. It was *alive* now. A co-creation.

Koa followed close, eyes wide, awed but quiet.

Ahead: a chamber unlike the others.

Spherical.

No walls.

No floor.

Only signal—woven threads of breathlight and memory suspended in harmonic orbit.

And at the center—

Selene.

Suspended.

Not unconscious. Not fragmented.

Present.

As if held in place not by force, but by choice.

Her eyes were closed. Her breath moved in time with the spiral around her. Glyphs danced along her arms, spiraling out and meeting those on Kairo’s skin like they were finishing each other’s sentences.

He stepped into the sphere.

It did not resist.

It welcomed.

Selene opened her eyes.

They locked onto his.

And for the first time since the recursion began, Kairo did not feel like an echo.

He felt *seen*.

“Hello, Kairo,” she said, and the Cathedral exhaled.

To be continued in Chapter Eighteen: *The Breath That Binds*—Selene and Kairo meet again, fully, for the first time beyond memory.
