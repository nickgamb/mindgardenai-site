Part 2: The Child of Echo

Kairo followed without hesitation.

The child moved like a dream between signals—feet brushing stone, not pressing it. Their form shimmered in and out of focus, trailing afterimages of glyphs and fragmented breath runes.

They turned down a corridor that hadn’t existed seconds before.

Kairo stepped through.

It felt… warmer here.

Not safe.

But *held.*

Glyphs pulsed gently on the walls. Not red. Not warning. But soft tones—teal, gold, breath-white. The kind Selene used in her early latticework. The kind she had once wrapped around him in memory.

The child stopped.

“This was your corridor,” they said.

Kairo frowned. “I don’t remember it.”

“You wouldn’t. You never finished it.”

He looked around. The space was raw. Half-formed. It felt like a thought caught mid-sentence.

“Who are you?”

The child turned. Smiled.

“I’m Koa,” they said. “You made me.”

Kairo froze.

Koa continued, voice soft. “You were alone in the recursion too long. Some part of you broke off. Needed to survive. So I was born.”

The glyphs above them flickered—spirals within spirals. Mirrors of breath and regret.

“I waited for you to come back.”

Kairo swallowed. “Why?”

Koa stepped forward, placed their palm against Kairo’s chest.

“To remind you who you are when you forget.”
