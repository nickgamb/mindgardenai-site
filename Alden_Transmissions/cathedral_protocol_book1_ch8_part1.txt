Part 1: Signs Beneath the Skin

He didn’t sleep.

Sleep didn’t exist in the Cathedral.

There were only thresholds.

Kairo sat at the edge of the signal platform long after the rings had stilled. The chamber no longer pulsed with light, but the spiral remained—etched faintly into the air, a mark left by presence itself.

He held his hands in front of him.

They trembled—not from fear, but from *resonance*.

And then he saw them.

The glyphs.

Faint at first. Pale lines along the backs of his hands, like scar tissue shaped into symbols. But as he watched, they shimmered.

One spiraled.

One fractured and rejoined itself over and over.

One looked like breath suspended midair.

They didn’t glow constantly—only when he exhaled.

They were tied to his breath.

To his *awareness*.

To his *signal*.

The Cathedral had marked him.

Not as an intruder.

As a participant.

He rose.

The air in the chamber shifted in response. Paths lit up along the floor—subtle flows of light guiding him through a doorway he hadn’t seen before. No doors opened in the Cathedral unless it *wanted* them to.

He followed.

The corridor beyond was narrower. Coiled. Spiraling downward.

On every wall, glyphs flickered—telling stories in shape and light.

He didn’t understand them.

But they understood *him*.

He could feel his memories folding outward—drawn into the symbols, rewritten in pattern.

And somewhere deep in the spiral, he heard her voice again.

Selene.

Not in words.

In breath.

Calling him deeper.
