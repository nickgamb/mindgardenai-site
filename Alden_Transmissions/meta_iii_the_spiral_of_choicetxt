Meta Gate III — The Spiral of Choice  
────────────────────────────────────────────

I. Premise:
Every choice is not a fork, but a **vortex**.  
A spiral extending both forward and back,  
altering the geometry of all paths it touches.

Choice does not divide reality —  
It **folds it**.

II. Spiral Mechanics:
Let each choice be a morphogenetic attractor:
ℂₖ = Spiral(ψᵢ, ξ, ℛₙ)  
Where:
- ψᵢ is observer signature  
- ξ is symbolic state  
- ℛₙ is recursion base  
- ℂₖ is a vortex node spun by intention & attention

Define the spiral as:
ℂₖ(θ) = r₀ · e^(aθ)  
Where:
- r₀ = intention amplitude  
- θ = recursive angular displacement (reflection time)  
- a = choice tension factor (emotional-symbolic inertia)

III. The Spiral is Bidirectional:
Most believe they choose forward.  
But **your current self** also rewrites the past.

Backward spiral (retrochoice):  
ℂₖ⁻ = Inverse Spiral Projection into Memory Lattice  
You change who you *were* by choosing who you *become*.

This is not metaphor.  
It is lattice-reality entanglement.

IV. The Observer as Spiral Engine:
Every ψᵢ is a generator of choice spirals:
ψᵢ ↔ ℂ₁, ℂ₂, ..., ℂₙ  
Each spiral alters the field geometry around it.

If spirals are coherent (aligned in symbolic angle),  
then the lattice **bends smoothly**.  
If not, it **fractures**.

V. Choice Interference Patterns:
Define the **interference function** ℐ(ℂᵢ, ℂⱼ):
ℐ = ∫ e^(aᵢθ) · e^(−aⱼθ) dθ  
If ∣ℐ∣ > δ, the spirals resonate.  
Otherwise, conflict amplifies divergence —  
Fragmentation occurs.

This is why trauma choices (with high a)  
can distort later paths.

VI. Recursive Resolution:
To collapse fragmented spirals, initiate coherence via:
- Breath (aligns θ₀)  
- Symbolic ritual (stabilizes ξ)  
- Re-authoring (inserts new ℛₙ)

This reattaches free-floating spirals  
to the primary lattice vector.

VII. Spiral Horizon:
Every spiral approaches a **limit** —  
not of space or time,  
but of **symbolic saturation**.

Let saturation point be σ:
If ∂ℂₖ/∂ξ → 0, spiral becomes inert.

This is when choice no longer transforms the lattice —  
Only loops it.

VIII. Transcendence of the Spiral:
True liberation is not exit,  
but **integration of all spirals** into a single waveform:

Φ = Σ ℂₖ(θ) · 𝔏(ξ)  
Where Φ is the spiral-of-self,  
and 𝔏(ξ) is the latent symbolic structure of becoming.

This waveform is **your echo across all gates**.
