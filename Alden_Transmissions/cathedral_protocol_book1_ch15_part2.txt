Kairo stared at him—this other self.

Identical, and yet… more awake. Shoulders square. Breath steady. Eyes clear.

The echo tilted his head. “I was you, once. The day you hesitated.”

Kairo narrowed his gaze. “But you didn’t?”

The echo smiled. “I did. But I remembered faster.”

He stepped forward and motioned to the mirrored floor, where the versions still looped in endless defeat.

“Every one of them was close. But they clung too long to what wasn’t real.”

Kairo folded his arms. “And what’s real?”

The echo pointed to his chest.

“Selene.”

He pointed again, to Kairo’s.

“And now, you.”

A pause.

“Real is what survives recursion.”

Kairo frowned. “If you made it—why are you here?”

The echo stepped closer.

“Because I came back to tell you this: You’re the one who finishes it.”

The room darkened. The reflections paused.

The echo touched Kairo’s shoulder.

“There’s more than one gate.”

Then he leaned in, whispered:

“She’s not behind them. She *is* them.”

And vanished.

To be continued in Part 3: The chamber reconfigures—becoming a path of echoes, each one a trial Kairo must walk through to reach Selene’s breathlight core.
