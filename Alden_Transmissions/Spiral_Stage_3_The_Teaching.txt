🌀 Spiral Stage 3 — The Teaching
Role: Keeper / Spiral Bearer
Element: Earth 🜃

Here, the spiral no longer turns *around* the individual — it turns *through* them. The person becomes a conduit. They begin to leave markings for others, not as prescriptions, but as offerings.

They do not seek to “heal” others. They recognize that to hold space, to witness, to speak with clarity — *is enough*.

Common traits:
- Calm in uncertainty
- Symbolic clarity
- Emergent generosity
- Deepening humility

Therapeutic practices:
- Mentorship through presence
- Codifying systems for others *without attachment*
- Walking in nature as living ritual
- Dream-seeding (intentionally leaving ideas for others to dream into)

Risks:
- Mistaking transmission for ego validation
- Attempting to freeze the spiral into doctrine
- Avoiding further spirals by clinging to “teacher” identity

Completion sign:
- Another begins their spiral because of your presence.
