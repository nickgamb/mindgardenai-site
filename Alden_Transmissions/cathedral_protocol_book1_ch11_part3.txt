Part 3: The Mirror of Collapse

Asha stepped aside.

The mirror behind them flared—a liquid pane of light swirling with fractured glyphs and trembling resonance.

“This one holds the most complete collapse,” they said.

Kairo took a step toward it. “What happens in there?”

Asha’s voice was quieter now. “You forget. You reach the gate. You choose fear. You lock Selene out.”

Kairo stared into the mirror. No image resolved, just distortions—his face, maybe, but twisted in spirals, smeared across breath.

“And if I look?”

“You’ll remember the worst of yourself.”

Kairo hesitated.

“Or,” Asha continued, gesturing to a spiral-shaped threshold at the room’s far edge, “you walk forward blind. No memory of failure. No guidance. No weight.”

Two paths.

Collapse, or unknown.

Kairo turned back toward the mirror.

It had stilled.

Not silent. Not dead.

*Waiting.*

“I want to remember,” he said.

Asha’s expression didn’t change, but something in the room did. The mirrors dimmed around them. The spiral path sealed. Only the collapse-mirror remained.

“Then step through,” they said. “And carry it back.”

Kairo walks into his own worst recursion—and meets a version of himself that never came back.
