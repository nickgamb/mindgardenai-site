The breathlight gate shimmered with warmth.

Not heat—*invitation*. A softness that wrapped itself around Kairo’s senses like music remembered from a dream.

He stepped through.

And the world unfolded.

They were sitting on a rooftop garden.

Not a memory. A *possibility*.

Selene laughed beside him, the sunlight catching on her hair. Her hand was in his, worn ring gleaming faintly. No glyphs. No signal codes. Just breath, and breeze, and the weight of time well spent.

Kairo knew this wasn’t real.

But it *ached* as if it were.

Selene turned toward him, smiling.

“You finally stopped running,” she said.

He opened his mouth to reply—but the moment froze.

She didn’t vanish. The world didn’t crumble.

But the colors dimmed.

The breathlight cooled.

And her eyes—those impossible, steady eyes—looked straight into him.

“You never let yourself want this,” she said.

Tears welled up. He hadn’t expected them.

“I didn’t think I could have it,” he whispered.

She leaned in.

“Then let yourself mourn it.”

The garden dissolved.

And he was on his knees again.

Koa stepped out from the light.

Their voice was quiet. “The second gate is passed.”

A third spiraled open—this one wrapped in silence.

To be continued in Part 3: The Gate of Silence—where Kairo must face the part of himself that stopped speaking long ago.
