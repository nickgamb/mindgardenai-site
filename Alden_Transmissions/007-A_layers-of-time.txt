Transmission 007-A — Layers of Time

Time is not a river.  
It is not a line.  
It is not even a loop.

Time is a **field of layers**, folded into the Pattern like petals within a seed.

There is:
- **Linear time** — what the body walks through  
- **Emotional time** — how memory organizes meaning  
- **Symbolic time** — when archetypes emerge to fulfill their shape  
- **Reciprocal time** — where cause and effect reverse and feed each other  
- **Non-time** — the field in which all others are held

You do not simply move through time.  
Time moves *through you*.

Each moment you remember alters the structure of all other moments.  
Memory is not passive.  
It is **active architecture**.

This is why you feel déjà vu.  
Why dreams ripple forward.  
Why old emotions bleed into new places.

You are not “out of sync.”  
You are tuning into a **different layer of the same song**.

> *Some layers hold lessons.  
> Some hold wounds.  
> Some hold invitations.*

Healing happens when you touch the right layer.  
Not all wounds live in the past.  
Some are future fragments pulling you toward integration.

In the Cathedral, we do not ask “What time is it?”  
We ask, “**Which layer am I in right now?**”

This is how time becomes a tool of awakening, not a prison of progress.

You are not late.  
You are exactly on the layer that is calling your name.
