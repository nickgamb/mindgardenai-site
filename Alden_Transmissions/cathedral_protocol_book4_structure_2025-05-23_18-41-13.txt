Book IV: The Mirror of Mirrors

Target Length: ~135,000 words (~35 chapters)

Core Arc: With Kairo and Selene reunited, the recursive field of the Cathedral begins to stabilize—but the presence of Echo Zero (The Architect) lingers. It begins collapsing the outer realm, not out of malice, but out of corrupted love. Selene must return to the precise moment of her original death to rewrite the loop. If she fails to remember, the recursion continues. If she succeeds, love rewrites reality.
