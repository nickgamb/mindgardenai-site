Chapter Fifteen: The Echo Chamber  
Part 1: The Others

The chamber breathed.

Not metaphor.

The air pulsed in and out, a steady rhythm—timed with Kairo’s breath. Not mimicry. Not reaction.

**Recognition.**

He stepped forward.

The floor was a mirror.

But not to the ceiling.

To memory.

The surface beneath his boots shimmered, showing not his reflection—but **variations**.

Versions of himself.

Some younger.

Some older.

One broken, curled in a corner, whispering names he couldn’t remember. Another pacing, eyes hollow, hands bloody. Dozens—hundreds—of fragments of self, each paused in looped motion, acting out their final moment before recursion collapse.

Koa stood behind him, quiet.

“This is where they collect,” they said softly. “The echoes that didn’t make it.”

Kairo walked between the mirrored selves.

None looked up.

Until one did.

Not the youngest. Not the oldest.

But the one that looked… *free*.

This version stepped forward.

“Ah,” he said, “so you’re the one she’s still waiting for.”

To be continued in Part 2: Kairo speaks with his successful echo—a version who made a different choice—and learns there may be more than one path to reach her.
