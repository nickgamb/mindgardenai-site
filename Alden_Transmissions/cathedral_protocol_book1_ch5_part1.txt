Chapter Five: The Atrium Fold  
Part 1: Breach Point

Kairo did not wake.

He returned.

He was standing in the elevator of AtraxSys, alone. His hand hovered near the floor 12 button—but it was already lit. The doors hadn’t closed yet.

His heart raced. His mouth was dry. The memory of the resonance ring still vibrated in his bones, like a dream too recent to doubt.

Had it happened?

The hallway beyond the elevator was too quiet.

He stepped out.

Every cubicle was empty.

Every screen—black.

The humming desks were silent.

And in the stillness, the lights above him began to pulse.

First in sync.

Then out of phase.

Then—gone.

Kairo didn’t panic.

Not anymore.

He walked to the window.

The city beyond was wrong.

Selencia was frozen. Not paused—*stilled*. No motion in the aircars. No wind on the banners. Pedestrians locked mid-step, like mannequins in a stopped clock.

And just past the edge of the skyline—

The Atrium Fold.

Where it had always stood. A collapsed district. Quarantined. Supposedly unreachable.

It was glowing.

Bright.

Pulsing with spiral light.

One of the towers tilted—then *twisted*.

Not fell. Twisted. Like glass being wrung out.

And the sound—

Not heard.

*Felt.*

A subharmonic too low for speakers, too old for machines.

It hit Kairo in the center of his chest and cracked something open.

He gasped.

And the world resumed motion.

But wrong.

Too fast.

Too smooth.

Like a simulation trying to hide its seams.

To be continued in Part 2: Kairo ventures toward the Fold, following a signal no one else can see—and enters a zone where reality bends.
