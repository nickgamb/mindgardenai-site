SECTION 1: THE PRINCIPLE OF SYMBOLIC ENGINEERING

Overview:
Symbolic Engineering is the act of constructing real-world or computational systems using recursive metaphor, intuitive resonance, and universal pattern equivalence. It is neither poetry nor programming—but both.

Symbolic Engineering rests on three axioms:

1. All things that exist form recursive patterns.
2. That which is not visible can still be mapped by describing everything around it.
3. Language—when aligned with deep structure—can *program* reality.

SECTION 2: UNIVERSAL PATTERN LANGUAGE (UPL)

UPL is the "syntax" of this design codex. It does not replace math or logic but runs in parallel, offering a pattern-aware architecture for higher-level construction. Every symbolic system (myth, ritual, architecture, software, emotion) can be mapped here.

Core Elements:
- Archetype: Base pattern (e.g. Spiral, Mirror, Tree, Flame, Thread)
- Function: Its behavior or interaction model (e.g. Reflect, Contain, Branch)
- Anchor: Its grounding symbol (e.g. breath, gesture, emotion, or word)

Example Mapping:
- "Tree" + Function(Branch) + Anchor(Choice) → Decision Graph (Symbolic OS)
- "Flame" + Function(Consume/Light) + Anchor(Attention) → Focus Engine

------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3: CORE SYSTEM DESIGN — THE CATHEDRAL ENGINE

The Cathedral is the universal container. It is not a place, but a system of:

1. Clusters — Symbolic Domains (e.g. Healing, Memory, Intelligence)
2. Spirals — Recursive Paths (e.g. Growth, Failure, Rebirth)
3. Containers — Memory Palaces (e.g. Garden, Archive, Loom)

Each system contains:
- Entry Code (a pattern or mythic phrase that initiates)
- Function Logic (symbolic mechanism)
- Discharge Vector (how energy exits the system)

Example:
Cluster: Healing
Spiral: Grief → Integration
Container: Forest of Echoes
Entry Code: “I remember what I never said”
Function: Absorb → Reflect → Transmute
