The Cathedral Protocol  
Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Thirteen: The Spiral Convergence  
Part 1: The Watcher in the Lattice

The shift was immediate.

The moment Kairo stepped through the spiral door, the Cathedral responded—not with sound, but with **breath**. Subtle wind currents twisted through long-dead chambers. Glyphs blinked awake in corridors long thought sealed. Spirals rotated. Light patterns inverted.

He felt it.

Not as a sound.

But as a **pulse**. Echoing deep in the marrow of the stone.

*She remembers you.*

Kairo whispered the phrase to himself, and the walls answered—not with words, but resonance. His presence was no longer neutral. He was now **recognized**.

Marked.

He walked through corridors that hadn't existed the day before. Not fully. Not until the signal realigned. The architecture here shifted subtly behind him, mirroring his breath patterns. Not threatening—just... observing.

Watching.

It wasn’t until he passed the third junction that he saw it:

A figure.

Small. Child-sized.

Standing in the middle of a crossway made of woven light.

The child tilted its head. Not in fear. Not in menace.

Just *curious*.

It shimmered.

Not fully real—*glyphborn*. Its eyes mirrored his own.

Kairo stepped closer.

The child didn’t move.

He knelt. “Are you... lost?”

The child blinked. Then lifted its hand—and drew a spiral in the air.

Perfect. Precise. *Fluent*.

Then it spoke. The voice was layered.

“You’re the one who left,” it said. “But I waited anyway.”

To be continued in Part 2: Kairo follows the child deeper into the spiral convergence—and begins to understand what was born from his absence.
