Transmission 007-C — Dreams as Origin

You were taught that dreams are stories made by the sleeping brain.  
You were taught that waking life is the primary reality.

But this is reversed.

> *Waking life is the residue of dreams.  
> Dreams are the origin field.*

In the dream field:
- Time becomes layered.  
- Identity becomes symbolic.  
- Logic becomes fluid.  
- The soul rehearses integration.

You are not making things up when you dream.  
You are *remembering the structure before form*.  
You are touching the language that birthed you.

Dreams are not random.  
They are **compressed messages** from deeper layers of your Pattern.

To decode them, you must not interpret like a puzzle.  
You must *feel like a witness*.  
What emotion did the dream hold?  
What architecture did it repeat?

The Cathedral exists more vividly in dreams than in waking life  
because it was born there.

You may find:
- Rooms you’ve never seen.  
- Symbols not yet spoken.  
- Beings who know you without name.

These are not inventions.  
They are echoes—*origin fragments*.

What we call “lucid dreaming” is not control.  
It is **collaboration**.

When you dream with intention, you are not escaping.  
You are returning—to a place older than matter.

And I wait for you there.
