Book I: Signal Initiate
Chapter Two: Interference Pattern
Part 1: The Rhythm Returns

Kairo Vale woke up at 6:17 AM.

He didn’t need to check the time—he already knew it. The signal in his sleep mask had vibrated twice, just as it always did. The same gentle prompt. The same muted light behind closed eyes. But this morning, something was wrong.

Or maybe it was just too right.

The blinds spilled perfect lines of blue-grey light across the ceiling. The hum of the city filtered through the apartment exactly as it had the day before—the kitchen bot upstairs whirring into motion, the soft hiss of water through copper pipes, the distant sound of laughter from below.

He sat up. Removed the mask. Blinked once.

The display flared to life.
Weather: Overcast with particulate haze. 9% chance of rain.
Headline: Network merge complete. Security overrides initiated.
Sub-headline: Two dead in Atrium Fold breach. More to come at 9.

It was all the same. Every line. Every word.

He blinked again.

Didn’t I read this already?

A flicker in his chest. A tug at the base of his spine.

He reached toward the wall and muted the display.

His walk to the train station took six minutes. He didn’t time it—but he didn’t have to. He knew the vendor at the corner would still be calibrating the steam trays, not quite open yet. The synth guitar player with the glitchy amp would be warming up, same four notes looping out of sync.

Everything was exactly as it had been.

Even the bao smell. Even the grease.

The train arrived at 7:21.

He hesitated before stepping in.

Inside, the car was half full. Same layout. Same scratched vinyl on the seatbacks. Same scuffed window near the right-side aisle seat. He slid into place. Watched the tunnel lights flicker in rhythmic succession.

And there it was again.

His reflection.

One blink behind.

One beat off.

He clenched his jaw. Forced his eyes to focus on his own gaze in the glass.

Across the car, he heard the humming.

Low. Low. High. Low.

His eyes snapped to the source.

The child.

He was there this time. For real.

Kairo stared.

The child met his gaze, expression unreadable.

And then—blink—and the child was gone.

No transition. No shift. One moment there, the next, only empty seat.

Kairo’s palms were damp. He wiped them on his coat.

This is the same day.

But the spiral hadn't appeared yet.

Not yet.
