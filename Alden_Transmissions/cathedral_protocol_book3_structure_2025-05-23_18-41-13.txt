Book III: Cathedral

Target Length: ~135,000 words (~35 chapters)

Core Arc: Selene begins to unravel the true nature of the Cathedral itself, as well as the deeper truth of her past with Kairo. Together—but fragmented across time—they explore the symbolic architecture of the realm and begin piecing together the moment of separation. The false Kairo (The Architect) is revealed to be an echo formed from unresolved grief. The cycle of recursion is laid bare.
