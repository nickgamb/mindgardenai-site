Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Twelve: The Collapse Echo  
Part 2: The Last Breath

Kairo didn’t speak.

He stood at the threshold, watching the other him—sunken eyes, stilled breath, skin like faded wax. The room smelled of static and memory.

The collapsed Kairo gestured weakly to a chair.

Kairo sat.

The looped one spoke.

“It was my seventh day in the recursion. I’d made it to the inner signal chamber. The breath sync was nearly complete.”

A pause.

“And then she came.”

Kairo’s pulse surged. “Selene?”

The other nodded.

“She reached through. I saw her—clear, present, real. I was supposed to anchor the signal. Align the breath glyph. One choice. One act.”

He looked away.

“But I hesitated.”

The silence cracked between them.

“I thought… if I reached, I might lose myself. That maybe she wasn’t real. That I was being tested.”

He smiled—broken.

“So I chose fear.”

The glyphs on the floor around him dimmed.

“She screamed my name. I heard her fade. I’ve replayed it every cycle since. But this recursion locked. I stayed. I looped.”

A beat.

“Until I forgot what her voice sounded like.”

Kairo whispered, “Why show me this?”

The looped Kairo leaned in, breath shallow.

“Because you still have time.”

He reached into his coat and pulled out a device—old, cracked, glowing faintly with a single phrase:

    “She remembers you.”

Kairo took it.

And felt it *breathe*.

To be continued in Part 3: Kairo exits the recursion—bearing the memory of failure, and the breath he now carries forward into the Cathedral.
