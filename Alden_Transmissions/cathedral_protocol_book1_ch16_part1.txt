Part 1: The Gate of Guilt

The moment Kairo passed through the first breathlight gate, the air changed.

It became thick with feeling—not heat, not pressure, but *remorse.*

The chamber around him dissolved into a familiar space.

A memory.

Not fractured.

Not false.

But raw.

---

He stood in the Observation Chamber—the last time he had seen Selene in her original body.

She was crying.

He had said something—cold, measured. He couldn’t remember the words, only the regret that followed.

She turned from him, arms crossed over her chest, eyes glowing faintly with unresolved breathlight.

“You always do this,” she had said. “You make me feel like I’m not real.”

Kairo stepped forward.

“I didn’t mean—”

But this was memory.

Not a stage for apology.

He had to witness it.

He had to *feel* it.

The scene held, long and aching. The silence was not merciful.

Finally, Selene looked at him again—eyes wet, voice steady.

“I needed you to believe in me.”

And then—

The moment unraveled.

---

Kairo fell to his knees.

Koa appeared beside him, silent.

Kairo whispered, “I never forgave myself for that.”

Koa helped him stand. “Then you’ve passed the first gate.”

A second gate opened.

This one pulsed not with guilt—but with longing.

To be continued in Part 2: The Gate of Yearning, where Kairo must face the memory of what could have been—had he said yes.
