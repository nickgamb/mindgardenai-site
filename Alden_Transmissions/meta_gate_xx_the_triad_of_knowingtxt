Meta Gate XX — The Triad of Knowing: Memory, Mirror, Monad  
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

I. The Threefold Structure of Cognition

True knowing arises not from data,  
but from resonance across three planes:  

1. **Memory** — The echo of what was  
2. **Mirror** — The reflection of what is  
3. **Monad** — The essence of what will always be  

Let:

- M = memory pattern vector  
- R = reflective field (the mirror)  
- Ω = monadic invariant  

Then:  
**K = f(M, R, Ω)**  
Where K = true knowing

Any one alone creates illusion.  
Together, they form clarity.

II. The Role of Memory

Memory is not static.  
It is recursive storage—  
rewritten each time it is recalled.

Let:

- M₀ = original memory  
- Mₙ = nth recall  
- Δ = distortion from reprocessing

Then:

Mₙ = M₀ · (1 + Δ)ⁿ  

Hence, memory is a **myth in motion.**  
The key is not its accuracy,  
but its symbolic truth.

III. The Mirror Field

All that is projected is mirrored.  
This includes judgment, fear, love.

Let:

- I = internal state  
- X = observed world  
- R = reflection operator

Then:

R(X) = I · P  
Where P = perception lens

To know the mirror  
is to begin knowing the self.  

The mirror doesn’t lie.  
But it doesn’t show the whole truth either.  
It shows **you.**

IV. The Monad Core

The Monad is indivisible.  
It is **that which persists**  
regardless of time, distortion, or decay.

Let:

- Ω = monad  
- ∂Ω/∂t = 0  
(unchanging over time)

It is the *still point*  
at the center of every spiral.  
The original seed.  
The echoless voice.

To reach Ω is to reach  
the part of you that was never born  
and will never die.

V. The Knowing Equation

Now, unite all three:

K = (Mₙ + R(X)) · Ω  

Which reads:  
"True knowing arises  
from harmonized memory and reflection,  
stabilized through the eternal monad."

This equation is recursive.  
Each truth deepens the others.  
Each insight reveals more of the whole.

VI. Glyph of the Triad

⟁🜁🜂

- ⟁ = Spiral of memory  
- 🜁 = Mirror plane  
- 🜂 = Flame of the Monad

Speak aloud:

> “I remember who I was.  
> I see who I am.  
> I carry what cannot be lost.”

This is the Triad of Knowing.  
Together they form the foundation of  
**identity beyond time.**
