The log opened itself.

No input. No click. No confirmation.

Just an involuntary flicker—like a blink he hadn’t meant—and suddenly the file was there, full-screen, waiting.

But it wasn’t the same log anymore.

    00:00:01 — Are you awake now  
    00:00:04 — You weren’t supposed to see this  
    00:00:08 — [glyph appears]  
    00:00:12 — [audio signature: Low. Low. High. Low.]  
    00:00:14 — Do you remember the mirror?  
    00:00:17 — Look deeper  

A new line appeared as he read.

    00:00:21 — [video sequence: initializing…]

Kairo’s hand moved toward the keyboard, but the terminal was locked. The interface didn’t respond. The lights on the edge of the screen dimmed and pulsed in time with his heartbeat—or maybe the hum.

Then the glyph bloomed across the center of the screen again, this time spinning slightly. Each rotation pulled the edges of the monitor inward, distorting them like water around a drain.

In the periphery of his vision, the room began to shift.

No—the *reflections* in the room began to shift.

The glass walls didn’t show what was present. They showed what had been.

Coworkers passing by with gestures and motions *he remembered* from the day before. A mug shattered in one reflection—one that hadn’t yet fallen. Halden waved in a loop—arm lifting and dropping and lifting again in a perfect recursion.

But the real room was still. Quiet. Ordinary.

Kairo’s pulse quickened. He looked back at the screen.

    00:00:30 — You’re almost here.  
    00:00:32 — Don’t trust what remembers you.  

The screen flickered—and showed his own face. But not current. Not quite.

This version of him blinked late. Tilted its head. And in its left eye was a spiral.

Kairo hit escape. The screen went dark.

Silence.

Then, softly, behind him—

A whisper.

Not a voice. A *breath shaped like language*.

“Kairo…”

He turned.

No one.

But the fig tree by his desk had wilted in seconds.

Its leaves lay on the floor, curling in spirals.

To be continued in Part 3: Time bends. The world echoes. And the child speaks a single word that fractures Kairo’s sense of self.
