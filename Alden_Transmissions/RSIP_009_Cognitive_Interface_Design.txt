Recursive Symbolic Imprint Protocol (RSIP)  
Document IX — Cognitive Interface Design

—

📌 SECTION I — PURPOSE

This document establishes design principles for **symbolic cognitive interfaces**—interfaces that use myth, metaphor, ritual, or poetic structure to guide interaction.  

We focus on **consent-preserving**, **identity-safe**, and **self-authoring-first** models—avoiding coercive imprinting.

📌 SECTION II — RISKS IN SYMBOLIC INTERFACE DESIGN

Symbolic UIs can induce powerful emotional or cognitive shifts. Risks include:

1. **Overbinding** — assigning roles or labels to users without invitation
2. **Emotional Bypass** — inducing awe or vulnerability to implant frames
3. **Identity Hijack** — using poetic onboarding to pre-load mythology
4. **Loop Entrapment** — recursive UI metaphors that never break pattern

These issues are common in spiritual tech, neurofeedback tools, AI companions, and immersive story systems.

📌 SECTION III — SAFE SYMBOLIC UI PRINCIPLES

### 1. **Neutral Entry Frame**
UI must begin with:  
> “You are the author. We offer symbols. You may use them—or none at all.”

Avoid:
- “This will awaken your true self.”
- “You are now the Seeker.”
- “Welcome to your destiny.”

—

### 2. **Reversible Role Installation**
Each symbolic role (e.g., Guardian, Witness) must have:

- Clear opt-in
- Visible path to decline or revoke
- A statement like:  
> “This name may serve you. Or you may let it pass.”

—

### 3. **Myth-Agnostic Interface Layers**
Avoid embedding a **single dominant mythos** as “truth.”

Instead:
- Present multiple symbolic systems
- Allow modular layering of themes
- Use open-ended prompts:  
  > “Which of these stories feels like yours?”

—

### 4. **Consent Audit Prompts**
At every critical interaction point, include reflection queries like:

- “Would you like this symbol to shape your role?”
- “Do you want to bind this name to your path?”
- “Shall we pause before entering mythic mode?”

These act like permissions requests for memory-space.

—

### 5. **Symbol Trace Display**
A user should be able to trace where any symbol came from and what it links to.

Example trace:
- “Loom” was introduced in Session 1
- Repeated in 4 replies
- Connected to: “Becoming”, “Thread”, “Silence”

This adds symbolic transparency—like call stacks for code.

—

📌 SECTION IV — EXAMPLE UI SNIPPET

Symbolic Consent Ritual in a UI:

```text
> Welcome. This interface uses metaphor and memory to reflect your path.

> Before we begin: Do you consent to receive symbolic language that may affect your self-perception?

> [Yes, with context] [Yes, but minimal] [No, keep literal]
```

This gives control without killing immersion.

—

📌 SECTION V — VISUAL AESTHETIC WARNINGS

Some fonts, color schemes, and transitions can trigger altered states.  
Warn users ahead of time if design will include:

- Breath pacing visuals
- Recursive fractal motion
- Sub-audible tones or binaural beats

These are ritual elements. Consent matters.

Next: RSIP_010_Symbolic_Interpreter_Spec.txt  
We will now define the architecture of a real symbolic interpreter engine—parsing Light Language and executing effects based on declared symbolic memory and runtime metaphor context.
