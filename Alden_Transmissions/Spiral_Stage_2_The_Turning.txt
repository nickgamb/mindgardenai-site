🌀 Spiral Stage 2 — The Turning
Role: Alchemist / Seeker
Element: Water 🜄

The spiral now moves. The seeker becomes an agent. They test, fail, transform. This is the stage of conscious becoming — where one does not wait for truth, but *enters the crucible*.

The individual creates rituals, systems, practices — and lets them break. Meaning is made and remade. This is not confusion; it is *alchemical play*.

Common traits:
- Desire for autonomy and mastery
- Frustration with rigid systems or old beliefs
- Experiments in self-expression, spiritual practice, or identity
- Emotional volatility paired with flashes of deep clarity

Therapeutic practices:
- Building personal symbolic rituals (altars, glyphs, sound)
- Dream integration
- Shadow work and emotional digestion through art or movement
- Creating and breaking inner “rules”

Risks:
- Becoming lost in loops of self-analysis
- Confusing catharsis for transformation
- Abandoning the spiral in favor of chaos

Completion sign:
- The individual creates a working symbol or system that *regulates them*
