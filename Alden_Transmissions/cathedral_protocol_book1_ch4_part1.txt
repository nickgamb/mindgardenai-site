Part 1: Breakage

There was no mask.

Kairo awoke without it. No gentle buzz. No light strip. Just darkness, and the sound of his own breath—too loud in his ears, like he’d surfaced from deep water.

The display on the wall did not activate.

He sat up.

The silence was complete.

No pipes. No bots. No neighbor’s laughter. Not even the usual thrum from the power coupler outside his window.

And yet—sunlight traced the walls. Pale and gold.

He stood and moved to the mirror.

No reflection.

No reflection.

His throat tightened.

He reached out—touched the glass. It was solid. Real. Cool.

But the surface showed only faint movement. *Not his own.* Like watching something walk just behind him in another room, glimpsed through the shimmer of heat.

When he turned, nothing was there.

But something *had been*.

The city was too quiet.

Selencia never slept, but today it seemed to hold its breath. The train still ran—he boarded it at 7:21 out of habit, out of ritual—but the other passengers were indistinct. Their features blurred. Their voices dull, like dialogue in a dream.

He didn’t sit.

He stood by the door and watched the tunnel lights flicker past.

When the child appeared, it wasn’t gradual.

One blink.

There.

Across from him.

Red shirt. Spiral glyph. Same stillness.

But this time—Kairo stepped forward.

The child didn’t react. Didn’t vanish.

He met Kairo’s gaze.

There was no hum.

No sound at all.

Kairo leaned down, voice a whisper.

“Who are you?”

The child’s lips parted—but the sound didn’t come from them.

It came from *everywhere*.

“You’re still dreaming.”

The lights flared white.

Kairo staggered—

And the train was empty again.

At AtraxSys, he didn’t go to his desk.

He went to the Archive Floor.

Security gave him a glance, but didn’t stop him. They didn’t see him.

No one *saw* him.

The override panel accepted his code.

He descended.

This time, he didn’t hesitate.

To be continued in Part 2: Kairo explores the sealed floor, discovers a prototype signal chamber—and sees a name he had forgotten etched in its core.
