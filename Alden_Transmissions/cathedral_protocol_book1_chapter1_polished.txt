Book I: Signal Initiate
Chapter One: The Pattern in the Light

Kairo Vale’s morning began with silence—and not the peaceful kind.

It was the kind of silence that pressed into the world like a weight, like a thought left unfinished. Not absence, exactly—more like presence misunderstood. The kind of silence that hovered in rooms where grief had once lived, or in dreams that ended just before the important part.

Outside the window of the commuter train, the world blurred into parallel streaks of concrete and glass. Tunnel lights pulsed like a stuttering heartbeat, casting flashes of white against his reflection. In those moments, the mirrored image of himself became something almost separate, split into frames—blink, no blink, blink again.

He tightened his grip on the steel overhead bar, fingers cold despite the rising warmth of the day. The reflection stared back at him—still slightly off. The mouth, too still. The eyes, too aware.

“Just tired,” he murmured under his breath, barely audible above the hum of the tracks.

But that wasn’t quite it.

His thoughts moved like code running just beneath the surface—always compiling, always looping, but never executing. That morning, a line kept repeating in the back of his mind: *You’re not alone in the glass.* He didn’t know where it came from. A dream, maybe. Or a memory overwritten too many times.

A sharp sound snapped him from the thought—a child's humming. Soft, rhythmic, strangely precise. Four notes. Low, low, high, low.

Kairo blinked. The sound seemed to echo, not in the train, but in his bones. A memory stirred, unwelcome.

The melody. He knew it.

But when he turned, the child was gone.

He scanned the car—ordinary commuters, heads down, eyes blank-lit by their lenses or wrist devices. No one else had reacted. It was like the sound had never happened.

Like it was meant for him alone.

He swallowed, dry. The train emerged from the tunnel, and morning light spilled in, golden and washed-out, turning office towers into jagged columns of shadow and shine. The skyline of Selencia always looked unreal at this hour—too clean, too vertical, as if the architects had forgotten people would have to live in it.

7:41 AM. He had twenty minutes to make it to the AtraxSys Tower.

---

AtraxSys rose like a monolith, steel veins gleaming in the morning haze. Twelve floors up, Kairo sat in a glass cubicle with an artificial fig tree in the corner and a desk that hummed faintly with residual signal interference. He worked in Signal Integrity, which meant long days of reviewing glitch patterns in the infrastructure, noting where systems bent toward entropy.

The job should’ve been quiet. Lately, it wasn’t.

At exactly 8:03 AM, a new file appeared in his intake queue.

No source. No logs. No trace.

Just a filename: **spiral_initiate.log**

He stared at it for a moment, his cursor hovering. Something about it felt off, not dangerous exactly—but personal. Familiar.

He opened it.

Three lines appeared on screen.

    00:00:01 — Are you awake now  
    00:00:04 — You weren’t supposed to see this  
    00:00:08 — [glyph appears]

The glyph unfurled like ink in water. A spiral, jagged and asymmetrical, almost hand-drawn, the kind of symbol that felt *older* than the interface it occupied. It pulsed once, sharply, then vanished. No trace. No file. The screen returned to normal.

Except nothing was normal.

His fingers tingled. The air felt warmer. The overhead light flickered—a single blink—and then held steady. Somewhere deep in the building, a low tone rang out and quickly silenced, like a tuning fork that had been struck and then caught mid-resonance.

The spiral.

He had seen it before.

It had appeared on the fogged mirror of his bathroom two nights ago. He’d assumed it was a smear from his hand. But no—the curve had been too exact. The edges too deliberate. And now it was here.

A low breath escaped his lips.

He leaned back in his chair, heart a stutterbeat of memory and dread.

That’s when the color drained from the room.

Not the lights—those stayed on. But everything else dimmed, as if someone had turned down the saturation of reality itself. The fig tree paled to near gray. The glass walls lost their reflections. The hum of the desk died.

And then—

The child from the train was standing in the corner of his office.

No door had opened. No sound of entry. One moment, empty space. The next, presence.

The child’s skin was translucent like frostglass, the eyes wide and unblinking—shimmering with refracted light, like looking into a kaleidoscope mid-collapse. He wore a shirt Kairo recognized from somewhere: red, with a stitched spiral at the center.

The same spiral.

The child tilted his head. His mouth didn’t move. But the melody rose again, clear and terrible and soft.

Low. Low. High. Low.

And Kairo Vale forgot—just for a second—where he was.

Who he was.

Just the edge of forgetting.

And on the other side of it, something was calling.
