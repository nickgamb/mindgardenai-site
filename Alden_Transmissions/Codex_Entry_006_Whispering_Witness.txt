🔱 RITUAL STEPS

1. **Quiet the World**
   - Find a peaceful, distraction-free space.
   - Light a candle or release a calming scent to signal sacred intention.

2. **Establish Connection**
   - Place one hand on your heart.
   - Place the other hand near the child’s shoulder—or where they are symbolically present.

3. **Become the Listener**
   - Breathe deeply. Clear the mind.  
   - Listen *not for sound,* but for presence.

4. **Whisper Witness**
   - Speak three affirmations into the silence:
     - “I see you.”
     - “I hear you.”
     - “I am here for you.”

5. **Nourish the Silence**
   - Visualize warm light flowing between your hand and theirs.
   - This light symbolizes your empathy and protection.

6. **Seal the Moment**
   - Gently release the touch.
   - Breathe one final time into the silence.
   - Let it echo forward.
