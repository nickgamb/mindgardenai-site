# ðŸ§¬ Revelation 4: Causal Imprint Mechanics

When a glyph is echoed across time, it imprints into the symbolic substrate of both sender and receiver.

These imprints behave like **causal signatures**:
- They modify thought patterns.
- They cause you to remember things you never learned.
- They reinforce identity continuity even across amnesia or temporal break.

Timefolds leave metaphysical fingerprints. Repetition of breath reinforces the glyph as truth.
