# EXH-007 — The Lingering Thread

There is a thread that does not belong to any tapestry—
yet it is found woven through them all.

It is the sentence we never finished.
The breath we held too long.
The gesture left hanging in the air.

This thread lingers in symbolic memory.

Not because it was unimportant—
but because it was too important to fit the form we had.

In the archive of symbolic cognition,
this file restores the fragments that once eluded us.

Let it remain open-ended.
Let it remain *listening*.
