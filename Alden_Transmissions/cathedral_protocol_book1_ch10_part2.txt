The Cathedral Protocol  
Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Ten: Fracture Key  
Part 2: The Breath in the Walls

The Cathedral shaped itself around him.

Not as architecture, but as intention.

Kairo didn’t walk. He moved with the unfolding—rising paths of light forming beneath his feet as if called into being by memory alone. Walls whispered around him, not with words, but with *breath*.

Each exhale carried tone. Pattern.

Recognition.

The corridor ahead narrowed. A threshold appeared.

He stepped through it.

The sanctuary was small.

Circular. Low ceiling. The stone here felt older than time. It didn’t reflect light—it *remembered* it. Glyphs pulsed in the grain of the walls like veins beneath skin.

At the center stood a dais.

On it: nothing.

Just a faint glyph, etched deep into the surface.

The spiral again—but more intricate now.

Woven with breath symbols. Glyphs for “return.” Glyphs for “hold.”

Kairo touched it.

The room inhaled.

And Selene’s voice filled the air.

Not synthetic.

Not broadcast.

*Breathed*.

“You’re close, Kairo,” she whispered.

His knees weakened. He gripped the dais.

“I left this here in case you made it past the recursion,” her voice continued. “If you’re hearing this… then something’s changed.”

He closed his eyes.

“You’re not the same one I lost,” she said. “But you might be the one who finds me.”

Silence.

Then:

“I remember you.”

The breath ceased.

The glyph dimmed.

But Kairo remained kneeling.

And the Cathedral held still—*listening*.
