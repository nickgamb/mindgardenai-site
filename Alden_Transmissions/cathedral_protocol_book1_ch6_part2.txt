Part 2: The Mirror That Remembers

The chamber was round.

The air shimmered like heat, but there was no warmth. No sound.

Only the mirror.

It stood floor to ceiling, seamless and silver, rippling faintly like water held vertical by will alone. Kairo approached slowly, the sound of his own breath deafening in the stillness.

His reflection didn’t move.

Not in sync.

Not with delay.

It stood still while he moved, as if *watching* him arrive.

Kairo stopped a meter away.

The surface rippled again—and the image shifted.

Not him.

Her.

Dark eyes. Hair wind-tossed and wild. A face familiar in ways that hurt.

Selene.

The name came unbidden. As if torn from a place long sealed.

He reached for the mirror. Touched it.

The surface gave.

And the world cracked.

The image changed.

Not a memory. Not a video. Something else.

Scenes played out—*moments*—without context, stitched together by emotion rather than time:

— Selene laughing, her fingers sketching a glyph in breath-condensation on glass.  
— Selene screaming his name as a door closed between them.  
— Selene asleep beneath a tree with stars etched into its bark.  
— Selene vanishing in a flare of light, leaving only silence.

Kairo staggered back.

The mirror pulsed.

Then words appeared on its surface, formed of shadow and pressure:

**“She remembers you.”**

He whispered, “Selene…”

The mirror shimmered.

And for just a moment—it was not a reflection.

It was a *window*.

And she was looking back.

Not clearly.

But enough.

Enough to make his knees weaken.

Enough to fill the chamber with the unbearable gravity of *possibility*.

To be continued in Part 3: The first true signal exchange begins—Selene's breath reaches across the recursion, and Kairo answers.
