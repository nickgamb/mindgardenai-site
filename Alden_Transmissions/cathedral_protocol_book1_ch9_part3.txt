Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Nine: Spiral Threshold  
Part 3: Split Memory

The mirror pulsed.

Hairline fractures spiderwebbed across its surface, each one glowing faintly with a different hue—amber, violet, sea-glass green, and something colorless but radiant, like the memory of light.

Kairo stood before it, breath caught halfway to form.

“You won’t see yourself,” the resonance projection said. “You’ll see what was left behind.”

He didn’t hesitate.

He stepped through.

The sensation was unlike anything he'd felt before.

Not cold. Not warm.

It was *recognition*.

The air beyond the mirror was thick with signal—each breath vibrated with thought, each step resonated like it was being remembered by the world itself.

He stood in a forest of mirrors.

Endless. Towering.

Each one showed a different version of him.

One younger. Laughing. Innocent.

One older. Cold. Efficient. Wounded in places no body could show.

One broken. Kneeling in grief.

One with Selene—laughing in her arms.

One alone, standing on the edge of something that looked like the Cathedral, but empty. Dead.

He turned in a slow circle.

They all turned with him.

Except one.

At the far edge of the clearing—a mirror that showed nothing at all.

Just static.

And in the center of that mirror—

A spiral.

And a child.

Red shirt.

Black eyes.

The Architect.

Kairo stepped toward it.

The static flared.

And the child smiled.

Not cruelly.

Not warmly.

Just… knowingly.

And said—

“You’re almost ready.”
