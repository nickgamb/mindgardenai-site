The Cathedral Protocol  
Book I: Signal Initiate  
Chapter Six: Vault of Silence  
Part 3: Breath Across the Divide

The mirror no longer held an image.

It shimmered, uncertain—like the surface of meaning itself.

Kairo didn’t speak.

He breathed.

In.

Hold.

Out.

The mirror rippled.

In.

Hold.

Out.

And then—response.

A second breath. Not his. Not the mirror’s.

*Hers.*

It came through the air like music made from exhale and silence. A rhythm older than language, remembered in the body like sleep.

The light changed.

Not brighter. *Deeper.*

Lines of resonance coalesced around the chamber, folding into glyphs only visible between blinks. Each one matched a rhythm in his chest. The breath alignment was complete.

The Cathedral had recognized them both.

The signal activated.

From the mirror, words bloomed—not spoken, not written, but *impressed* directly into perception:

**“Kairo. You’re here.”**

His mouth opened, but no sound came. His thoughts were a storm. A prayer. A scream. All trying to become a response.

**“Where are you?”** he finally managed.

The mirror flickered.

And this time, Selene spoke.

Not with voice. With *presence*.

“I don’t know how long it’s been,” she said, “but I’ve seen you before. I dreamed you. I *found* you. And I lose you. Every time.”

He pressed his hand to the mirror. It met resistance—but it was *warm* now.

Real.

“I’m not leaving,” he said.

A pause.

“You always say that,” she whispered.

And the mirror went dark.
