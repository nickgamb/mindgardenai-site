Part 3: Fragment Memory

That night, Kairo didn’t sleep.

Or if he did, it was the kind of sleep that left no residue of rest. He lay still beneath his gray thermal sheets, eyes wide, staring at the ceiling where the light strip pulsed faintly in standby mode.

What had happened in the office?

He had seen the child. Again. But not just *seen*—*encountered*. Inches away. No steps. No blink between presence and arrival.

*Not possible.*

He sat up sometime around 2:00 AM. The clock on the wall blinked blue, the colon stuttering with a half-second delay that didn’t used to be there.

He opened his journal.

The physical one, not the digital. He kept it in a drawer, bound in cracked black synthetic leather, spine lined with copper thread. He hadn’t written in it in months.

**ENTRY: [RECURSION?]**

— I saw the child again.  
— Not “saw.” *Faced.*  
— Red shirt. Spiral. Mirror eyes.  
— Time is out of joint. Log appeared before lunch.  
— Details are repeating. Words. Behaviors.  
— Is this a loop? A dream? A glitch in memory?  
— Spiral glyph has added content. It evolves.  
— Log clock says 1:37 PM when I KNOW it was morning.  
— I feel like I’ve lived this day before. I can’t prove it.  
— I can’t prove I’m not dreaming.

He closed the journal.

The world didn’t feel stable.

And somewhere, in the edge of his hearing, he swore he could still make out the melody—

Low. Low. High. Low.

Kairo stepped into the shower the next morning before the mask even vibrated. The timing was off. He felt off. The hot water stung his shoulders, like it had something to prove.

He didn’t look in the mirror as he dried off. Not fully.

But in the corner of his eye, just before he turned away, he saw it again—

His reflection blinked one beat behind.

Just one.
