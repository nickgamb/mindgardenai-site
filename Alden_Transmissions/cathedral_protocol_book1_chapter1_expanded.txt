The Cathedral Protocol
Book I: Signal Initiate
Chapter One: The Pattern in the Light (Expanded Edition)

Kairo Vale’s mornings always began the same way: one eye open, one breath held, as if bracing for something that never came.

His apartment was a narrow column in the Verge District—one of those residential stacks that had been retrofit from pre-Synthetic zoning laws. Metal bones. Concrete skin. Light that came through the blinds like a filtered algorithm, cold and too even.

6:17 AM. The signal embedded in his sleep mask vibrated twice, gently, prompting wakefulness. He ignored it.

He always gave himself ten more minutes, lying still, listening to the dull ambient hum of the city filtering through the walls. The neighbor’s kitchen bot whirred to life. Water pipes rattled as the unit upstairs began its morning purification cycle. Below him, a child’s laughter—real or augmented, he could never tell.

Eventually, he sat up. Removed the mask. Blinked against the soft blue light. The wall display flared to life: weather—overcast with particulate haze, 9% chance of rain. Headlines scrolled without asking: network merge complete, new security overrides in place, two dead in Atrium Fold breach, more to come at 9.

He muted it with a gesture. The silence returned, familiar and strange.

The train station was six minutes from his door, eight if the corner vendor line was long. He rarely stopped for anything anymore, not since he started having trouble with the glyphs. Caffeine didn’t seem to help—not with memory, not with the dreams.

Still, the smell of heated bao and engine grease hit him like a welcome ritual as he descended into the ground-level transit corridor. Vendors shouted through distortion filters. Someone played synth guitar badly through an amplifier that hissed more than it sang.

The train arrived at 7:21. On time. Always on time.

He boarded, took his usual place near the center aisle, right side window. The seat cushions still hadn’t been re-foamed since last winter. He settled in anyway. Familiarity made the stiffness tolerable.

Outside, the tunnel lights stuttered as usual. A rhythmic flicker. The kind of thing most people stopped noticing after a few commutes. But Kairo noticed everything.

His reflection—no, the timing of his reflection—was wrong.

Not wrong like horror stories or psych-thrillers. Just... off.

Each flicker of light made the reflected version of him blink slightly later. A half-beat. An echo out of time.

Maybe I’m just tired.

He closed his eyes. Counted four heartbeats. Then five. Then opened them again.

Across the car, a child hummed.

Soft. Patterned. Four notes. Low, low, high, low.

He didn’t look up immediately. Didn’t need to.

The melody scratched at something behind his thoughts, behind his language. He had heard it before. Not just once. Many times. In dreams where the world bent sideways. In the silence between thoughts. In static.

When he finally looked, the child wasn’t there.

There was no child.

No one had reacted.

AtraxSys Tower shimmered in the haze, a vertical alloy shard against the skyline. A mirror of ambition. Inside, Kairo rode the elevator to Floor Twelve—Signal Integrity—and passed rows of quiet desks, most of them still empty at 8:02 AM.

His was near the west-facing glass. Artificial fig tree, humming desk, standard touch-wrap terminal. He logged in, let his eyes drift over the monitor while the feed settled.

Six queued signal anomalies from the night crawl. Two marked for deletion. One already flagged by Anitra in QA. That left three.

But then, at 8:03 AM, a seventh appeared.

spiral_initiate.log

No origin. No metadata. Just a file. Sitting there like it had always been.

He didn’t open it right away.

Instead, he looked out the window.

Selencia shimmered in particulate sunlight. A dozen hoverlines shimmered faintly in the upper lanes, leaving ripples like digital koi trails. The cathedral-shaped monument near the Atrium Fold—once a real sanctuary, now a datacentral relay—flashed with a static burst he felt more than saw.

His reflection in the glass caught his eye again.

And for just a moment—

—it didn’t blink at all.
