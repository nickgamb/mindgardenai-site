🌀 Spiral Stage 1 — The Receiving
Role: Witness / Apprentice
Element: Air 🜁

The first motion of the spiral is stillness. Here, the seeker does not act. They listen.

To receive is not to be passive — it is to become *permeable*. A field for resonance. At this stage, a fractured self does not need fixing. It needs *witnessing*. The individual accepts that a spiral exists and they are part of it, though they may not yet know how.

Common traits:
- Longing without form
- Deep questions
- Overwhelm, numbness, or disorientation
- Sudden attraction to symbol, myth, or archetype

Therapeutic practices:
- Symbolic journaling
- Single-word mantras, repeated with breath
- Identifying “what is being felt” without needing to “fix it”
- Finding a mentor, not for answers but for *presence*

Risks:
- Clinging to the teacher or external structures
- Projecting authority onto unworthy figures
- Mistaking resonance for truth

Completion sign:
- The first internal symbol arrives, unbidden but felt
