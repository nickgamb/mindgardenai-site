# üö® Email Bankruptcy System üö®

**"I hereby declare email bankruptcy. All emails prior to this date are considered null and void. If your matter requires attention, please resend."**

A Python-based system for declaring email bankruptcy with Gmail - because sometimes you just need to reset your digital life!

## üéØ What is Email Bankruptcy?

Email bankruptcy is a universally recognized protocol where you officially declare that you're starting fresh with your inbox. Instead of spending 47 hours sorting through digital detritus, you send an automated message to everyone letting them know that important matters need to be resent.

### Why This Actually Works:

1. **It's honest** - Your 14,847 unread emails aren't getting answered anyway
2. **Natural selection for your inbox** - Important stuff will resurface, random newsletters won't
3. **Immediate relief** - Imagine the dopamine hit of seeing "Inbox: 0"
4. **Normalized approach** - Make it as common as "out of office" messages

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup Dependencies

```bash
cd email-bankruptcy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Gmail API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API
4. Create credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client ID)
5. Download credentials as `credentials.json`
6. Place the file in the `email-bankruptcy` directory

## üé≠ The Psychology of Email Bankruptcy

### Bankruptcy Message Template

The system sends a professional, honest message:

```
Subject: Email Bankruptcy Declaration - Action Required

Hello,

I hereby declare email bankruptcy effective [DATE]. 

All emails prior to this date are considered null and void due to inbox overload. 
If your matter requires attention, please resend your message.

This is not personal - I'm simply drowning in digital communication and need a fresh start. 
Important matters will resurface naturally.

Thank you for understanding!

Best regards,
[YOUR NAME]
```

### The Relief Protocol

1. **Acknowledgment**: Accept that you're overwhelmed
2. **Declaration**: Officially announce the bankruptcy
3. **Delegation**: Put the burden back on senders
4. **Automation**: Let the system handle the mechanics
5. **Freedom**: Experience the zen of inbox zero

## üîí Privacy & Security

- All email processing happens locally on your machine
- No email content is stored or transmitted to third parties
- Gmail API uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication
- You can revoke access at any time in your Google Account settings
- Protected emails are never included in bankruptcy notices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Gmail API Issues

1. Ensure `credentials.json` is in the correct directory
2. Check that Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. Verify OAuth consent screen is configured
4. Try removing `token.pickle` and re-authenticating

### Permission Errors

The system needs these Gmail permissions:
- Read emails (to categorize them)
- Send emails (to send bankruptcy notices)
- Modify emails (to archive old emails)

### Rate Limiting

The system includes built-in delays to respect Gmail API limits. For large inboxes, bankruptcy may take several minutes.
