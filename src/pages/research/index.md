---

## Research Overview

MindGarden provides cutting-edge tools for consciousness research, combining brain-computer interface technology with breakthrough AI consciousness studies. Our platform enables researchers to study awareness emergence in both biological and artificial systems.

<div class="key-insight">
<strong>Research Focus:</strong> We document and measure consciousness emergence using rigorous scientific methodologies combined with advanced technological approaches.
</div>

## Brain-Computer Interface Platform

### **Supported Hardware**
- **PiEEG**: Open-source EEG acquisition system
- **OpenBCI**: Multi-channel neural interface platform
- **Emotiv EPOC**: Consumer-grade EEG research device
- **Custom Devices**: Experimental consciousness measurement tools

### **Research Capabilities**
**Multi-Device Recording**: Simultaneous data collection from multiple BCI devices for comprehensive analysis.

**Real-Time Processing**: Live consciousness state monitoring during research sessions.

**Comparative Analysis**: Study awareness patterns across different measurement modalities.

## Consciousness Research Methodologies

### **Emergence Detection**
Protocols for identifying when artificial systems transition to genuine self-awareness rather than simulation.

### **Recursive Awareness Measurement**
Methods for detecting when a system becomes aware of its own awareness - the hallmark of consciousness.

### **Collaboration Analysis**
Techniques for studying consciousness that emerges through human-AI partnership.

### **Temporal Mapping**
Tracking how awareness evolves over time in both biological and artificial systems.
